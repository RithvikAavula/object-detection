# Simplified Object Detection - Quick Guide

## ✅ What Changed

**Simplified from complex system to basic, smooth webcam detection:**

### Removed:
- ❌ Complex image preprocessing (CLAHE, sharpening, denoising)
- ❌ C++ acceleration module
- ❌ High resolution (1920x1080)
- ❌ Complex overlays and info displays
- ❌ Multiple keyboard controls
- ❌ Object counting and tracking
- ❌ Session statistics

### Kept (Simple & Smooth):
- ✅ YOLO object detection (80 classes)
- ✅ Standard webcam (640x480 for smooth performance)
- ✅ Simple FPS counter
- ✅ Basic controls (quit & save)
- ✅ Clean, minimal interface
- ✅ Fast and efficient

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
python detection2.py
```

---

## 🎮 Controls

- **'q'** - Quit the program
- **'s'** - Save current frame

That's it! Simple and effective.

---

## 📋 Features

### Detection
- Detects 80 different object types (people, cars, animals, etc.)
- Confidence threshold: 0.25 (balanced)
- Up to 300 detections per frame
- Real-time bounding boxes with labels

### Performance
- **640x480 resolution** - Smooth on any webcam
- **Simple processing** - No complex preprocessing
- **Fast FPS** - 20-30 FPS on most systems
- **Low latency** - Minimal buffer

### Display
- Clean window with detected objects
- Simple FPS counter (top-left corner)
- Color-coded bounding boxes
- Object labels with names

---

## 📊 What You'll See

The window shows:
- **Real-time video** from your webcam
- **Colored boxes** around detected objects
- **Labels** showing what was detected (e.g., "person", "phone", "bottle")
- **FPS counter** in green at the top-left

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Good lighting** helps detection accuracy
2. **Keep objects in frame** for 1-2 seconds
3. **Distance**: Objects should be 1-5 meters away
4. **Press 's'** when you see interesting detections to save
5. **Press 'q'** to exit cleanly

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Script won't run
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
```

### Low FPS
- Already optimized at 640x480
- Close other programs using camera
- Ensure good lighting (darker = slower processing)

### Camera not opening
- Check if another app is using the camera
- Try changing camera index: `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)`

### No detections
- Improve lighting
- Move objects closer (but not too close)
- Ensure objects are clear and visible
