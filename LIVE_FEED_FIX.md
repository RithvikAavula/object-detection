# 🔥 CRITICAL FIX: Live Feed Now Shows Immediately!

## Problem You Reported

> "still live feed is not shown when camera is on on frontend"

**Symptoms:**
- ✅ Camera permission granted
- ✅ Camera light turns on
- ❌ Live feed NOT visible
- ❌ Stuck on "Starting Camera..."

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The video element was **HIDDEN** and only processed frames were displayed:

```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
<video ref={videoRef} style={{ display: 'none' }} /> // ❌ Hidden!

{processedFrame ? (
  <img src={processedFrame} /> // Only this showed
) : (
  <div>Starting Camera...</div> // Stuck here!
)}
```

**Why this failed:**
1. Camera starts successfully ✅
2. Video element hidden for frame capture only
3. Waiting for backend to process first frame (~100-200ms)
4. **NO LIVE FEED** shown during wait
5. User sees "Starting Camera..." and thinks it's broken

---

## ✅ The Fix

Now shows **LIVE camera feed** immediately while waiting for processed frames:

```javascript
// NEW (FIXED):
{processedFrame ? (
  // Show processed frame with bounding boxes
  <img src={processedFrame} />
) : cameraReady ? (
  // ✅ Show LIVE camera feed RIGHT AWAY!
  <video ref={videoRef} autoPlay muted />
) : (
  // Show loading
  <div>Starting Camera...</div>
)}
```
